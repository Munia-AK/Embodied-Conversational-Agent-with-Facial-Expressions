# Embodied-Conversational-Agent-with-Facial-Expressions
a virtual human that acts as your virtual friend generating conversations and conveying its feelings.

Open-Domain Conversational Digital Human System that allows you to have a friendly virtual avatar and establishes realistic interaction with users. 
The system consists of a 3d virtual character and multiple python models each specified for completing a task like emotion recognition, dialogue generation, facial expression extraction,
animations, text to speech and speech to text conversion.

This project is a graduate project for my Master's course.
Some of the models were fine-tuned while the others were directly employed
The models are:

Emotion Recognition: video-based and text-based
Chatbot for dialog generation
Speech recognition
speech synthesizer

I will soon add all the codes.
